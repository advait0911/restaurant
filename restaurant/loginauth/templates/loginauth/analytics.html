<p> 
I am creating a restaurant management system 
and I want to track the analytics of my customers. 
I want to know how many customers are visiting my restaurant, 
what dishes they are ordering, and how much they are spending. 
I also want to know the peak hours of my restaurant and the demographics of my customers. 
This information will help me make informed decisions about my menu, pricing, and marketing strategies.
